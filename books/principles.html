      <h2>Introducion</h2>
      <p>When you enter into relationships with others, your principles and their principles will determine how you interact. People who have shared values and principles get along. People who don't will suffer through constant misunderstandings and conflicts. [p.xi]</p>
      <p>To make money in the markets, one needs to be an independent thinker who bets against the consensus and is right. [p.xii-xiv]</p>
      <p>Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision. [p.xiv]</p>
      <p>Meaningful work and meaningful relationships (gave me more) than conventional success. [p.xvi]</p>
      <p>The power of the group is greater than the power of an individual.** [p.xvii]</p>
      <p>Ask yourself what you want, seek out examples of other people who got what they wanted, and try to discern the cause-and-effect patterns behind their achievements so you can apply them to help you achieve your own goals.[p.4]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>I gradually learned that prices reflect people's expectations, so they go up when actual results are better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected. And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences.** [p.11]</p>
      <p>I learned not to believe government policymakers when they assure you they won't let a currency devaluation happen. The more strongly they make those assurances, the more desperate the situation probably is, so the more likely it is that a devaluation will take place. [p.14]</p>
      <p>My failure to anticipate this, I realized, was due to my being surprised by something that hadn’t happened in my lifetime, though it had happened many times before. [p.15]</p>
      <p>When everybody thinks the same thing — such as what a sure bet the Nifty 50 is — it is almost certainly reflected in the price, and betting on it is probably going to be a mistake. [p.16]</p>
      <p>For every action (such as easy money and credit) there is a consequence (in this case, higher inflation) roughly proportionate to that action, which causes an approximately equal and opposite reaction (tightening of money and credit) and market reversals. [p.16]</p>
      <p>It taught me the importance of risk controls because I never wanted to experience that pain again. [p.18]</p>
      <p>Make sure that no single bet, or even multiple bets, could cause me to lose more than an acceptable amount.** [p.18]</p>
      <p>You have to be defensive and aggressive at the same time. If you are not aggressive, you are not going to make money, and if you are not defensive, you are not going to keep money.** [p.18]</p>
      <p>As long as my basic living expenses were covered, I knew I’d be happy. [p.20]</p>
      <p>I loved them (livestock, grain, oilseed markets) because they were concrete and less subject than stocks to distorted perceptions of value. While stocks could stay too high or too low because “greater fools” kept buying or selling them, livestock ended up on the meat counter where it would be priced based on what consumers were willing to pay. [p.20]</p>
      <p>It’s senseless to have making money as your goal as money has no intrinsic value — its value comes from what it can buy, and it can’t buy everything.** [p.22]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>There are anxious times in every investor’s career when your expectations of what should be happening aren’t aligned with what is happening and you don’t know if you’re looking at great opportunities or catastrophic mistakes. [p.29]</p>
      <p>All of this pounded an indelible lesson into my head: Timing is everything. [p.29]</p>
      <p>I just want to be right—I don’t care if the right answer comes from me. I saw that the only way I could succeed would be to:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning.</p>
              <p>• Know when not to have an opinion.</P>
              <p>• Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles.</p>
              <p>• Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside. [p.36]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>A meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreements and explores and weighs people's opinions in proportion to their merits. [p.36]</p>
      <p>To do exceptionally well you have to push your limits and that, if you push your limits, you will crash and it will hurt a lot. You will think you have failed — but that won’t be true unless you give up. [p.37]</p>
