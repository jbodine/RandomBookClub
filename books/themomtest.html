      <h2>Introducion</h2>
      <p>Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating a delicate archaeological site. The truth is down there somewhere, but it's fragile. [p.v]</p>
      <p>Bad customer conversations aren't just useless. Worse, they convince you that you're on the right path. [p.vi]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers lives and world views. [p.5]</p>
      <p>If you just avoid mentioning your idea, you automatically start asking better questions. Doing this is the easiest (and biggest) improvement you can make to your customer conversations. [p.7]</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The Mom Test:</p>
            <p>1. Talk about their life instead of your idea</p>
            <p>2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future</p>
            <p>3. Talk less and listen more [p.7]</p>
