      <h2>Introducion</h2>
      <p>Trying to learn from customer conversations is like excavating a delicate archaeological site. The truth is down there somewhere, but it's fragile. [p.v]</p>
      <p>Bad customer conversations aren't just useless. Worse, they convince you that you're on the right path. [p.vi]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers' lives and world views. [p.5]</p>
      <p>If you just avoid mentioning your idea, you automatically start asking better questions. Doing this is the easiest (and biggest) improvement you can make to your customer conversations. [p.7]</p>
      <p>The Mom Test:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>1. Talk about their life instead of your idea</p>
            <p>2. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future</p>
            <p>3. Talk less and listen more [p.7]</p>
        </blockquote>
    </section>
    <p>Only the market can tell if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion. [p.8]</p>
    <p>Ask them to show you how they currently do it. Talk about which parts they love and hate. Ask which other tools and processes they tried before settling on this one. [p.8]</p>
    <p>Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. Ask them to talk you through what happened the last time X came up [p.9]</p>
