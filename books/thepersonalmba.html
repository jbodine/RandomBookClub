      <p>“Whoever best describes the problem is the one who is most likely to solve it.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>Every successful business: [p.?]</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Provides something of value.</p>
              <p>• That other people want or need.</p>
              <p>• At a price they are willing to pay.</p>
              <p>• That satisfies the purchasers needs and expectations.</p>
              <p>• And provides the business revenue to make it worthwhile for the owners to continue operation.</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>Customer satisfaction depends on reliably exceeding the customers expectations. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Return On Investment - is always directly related to how much you spend. ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>“Make something people want. If you find something broken that you can fix for a lot of people, you’ve found a gold mine.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>“A business is a repeatable process that makes money, everything else is a hobby.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>Value creation, marketing, sales, value delivery, finance. [p.?]</p>
      <p>To build a successful business you should have a basic understanding of what people want (Maslow’s hierarchy of needs) - ERG theory: existence, relatedness and growth. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Core human drives - to acquire, to bond, to learn, to defend, to feel. [p.?]</p>
      <p>As an individual, paying attention to how much you value status is useful when making buying decisions. [p.?]</p>
      <p>“So often people are working hard at the wrong thing." ** [p.?] </p>
      <p>Rate on a 0-10 scale: urgency, market size, pricing potential, cost of customer acquisition, cost of value delivery, uniqueness of offer, speed to market, up-front investment, up-sell potential, evergreen potential. [p.?] </p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• Below 50 = move on to another idea.</p>
          <p>• Above 75 = promising idea.</p>
          <p>• 50-75 = has the potential to pay the bills.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>“Value is not intrinsic, it is not in things. It is within us; it is the way in which man reacts to the conditions of his environment.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>“The human species is composed of two distinct races: men who borrow and men who lend.” (money talks, but credit has an echo) ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>Options are often an overlooked form of value - flexibility is one of the three universal currencies. Giving people more flexibility can lead to a valuable business model. ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>“On their own, ideas are largely worthless - discovering whether or not you can actually make them work in reality is the most important job.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>Iteration: watch, ideate, guess, which (change), act, measure. [p.?]</p>
      <p>“Iteration velocity: our goal is to have more at bats per unit of time and money then anyone else.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>Feedback: ask open ended questions. short, who, when, where, why questions typically work best. Watch what they do and compare their actions to what they say. [p.?]</p>
      <p>“If no one seems to care about what you’ve created, you don’t have a viable business idea.” ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>Economic values: a successful business is either loved or needed.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• 1. Efficiency (how well it works).</p>
          <p>• 2. Speed.</p>
          <p>• 3. Reliability.</p>
          <p>• 4. Ease of use.</p>
          <p>• 5. Flexibility.</p>
          <p>• 6. Status.</p>
          <p>• 7. Aesthetic appeal.</p>
          <p>• 8. Emotion.</p>
          <p>• 9. Cost.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Things that are quick, reliable, easy and flexible are convenient. Things that offer quality, status, aesthetic appeal, or emotional impact are high-fidelity. ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>Each improvement you make can be thought of in terms of improving either of the above. The most successful offerings try to provide to the most convenience or fidelity among all competing offers. [p.?]</p>
      <p>“The best way to discover what people actually value is to ask them to make explicit trade-off’s during the research process. They must male a decision otherwise they will want everything.” Use relative importance testing (asking questions designed to simulate real life trade-offs). [p.?]</p>
      <p>Field testing: using what you make everyday is the best way to improve the quality of what you’re offering. (Be your products most avid and demanding customer).[p.?]</p>
      <p>Marketing is about getting noticed; where sales is about closing the deal. Business is about making profitable sales, not winning a popularity contest. ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>“Focus on getting the attention of the right people at the right time (a specific core audience). Attempting to appeal to everyone is a waste of time and money. [p.?]</p>
      <p>“It’s often far more comfortable to focus on the features, yet it’s far more effective to focus on the benefits: what your offer will provide to customers. The end result matters most.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>“The more clearly you define your ideal customer, the better you can screen out the prospects who don’t fit that description and the more you can focus on serving your best customers well.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>“It’s almost impossible to make someone want something they don’t already desire” (don’t promise something you can’t deliver). [p.?]</p>
      <p>Effective marketing is discovering what people already want and present it in a way that intersects with pre-existing desire. [p.?]</p>
      <p>The most effective way to get people to want something is to encourage them to visualize what their life would be like once they have accepted your offer. Do this by exposing them to as much sensory information as possible. [p.?] </p>
      <p>“Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is perspective, not the truth.” ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>“Attention is necessary to attract paying customers, but if that attention never leads to sales, it won’t sustain your business.” [p.?]</p>
      <p>If you position is agreeable to everyone, it becomes so boring that no one will pay attention to you - controversy provokes a discussion. [p.?]</p>
      <p>“Theres only one boss: the customer and he can fire everyone in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else.” ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>The object is to get to the point where you make your first profitable transaction as quickly as you can. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Pricing uncertainty principle - all prices are arbitrary and malleable - any price can be set to any level at anytime, without limitation. ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>Four phases of successful selling: [p.?]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• 1. Understand the situation.</p>
          <p>• 2. Defining the problem.</p>
          <p>• 3. Clarifying the short-term and long-term implications of that problem.</p>
          <p>• 4. Quantifying the financial and emotional benefits.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Three universal currencies: [p.?]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• 1. Resources.</p>
          <p>• 2. Time.</p>
          <p>• 3. Flexability.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Sales: Negotiation: [p.?]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• 1. What exactly will you propose?</p>
          <p>• 2. What are primary benefits of your proposal?</p>
          <p>• 3. What is the other parties next best alternative and how is your proposal better?</p>
          <p>• 4. How will you overcome the parties objections?</p>
          <p>• 5. Are there trade-offs or confessions you’re willing to make to reach an agreement?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The goal in negotiating is to find common ground (win-win) ** [p.?]</p>
      <p>Buffers - can be a highly valuable resource as long as you’re clear about how they’ll be rewarded, what they’re responsible for and how you intend to work together. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Damaging admission - by being up front with your prospects regarding drawbacks and trade - offs, you’ll enhance your trustworthiness and close more sales. [p.?]</p>
      <p>As a general rule - the less human involvement required to create and deliver value, the more sealable the business. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Barriers to purchase: [p.?]</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>• 1. It costs too much (makes spending $ feel like a loss i.e. buyers remorse).</p>
          <p>• 2. it won’t work.</p>
          <p>• 3. it won’t work for me.</p>
          <p>• 4. I can wait.</p>
          <p>• 5. it’s too difficult (too hard to manage)</p>
          <p>• These objections are very common, so build them into the structures of your initial offering (reference page 138).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A customers perception of quality relies on two criteria: expectations and performance. (quality = performance (minus) expectations.) [p.?]</p>
      <p>Humans don’t scale, individuals only have so much time and energy but that constraint doesn’t change with the volume of work to be done. A persons effectiveness usually goes down as the demands on them increase. As a result, services are typically difficult to scale. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Systemization: “if you can’t describe what you are doing as a process, you don’t know what you are doing”. [p.?]</p>
      <p>Business can be a creative endeavor - a way to explore what’s possible, help others and support yourself at the same time. ** [p.?]</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>- Assets (minus) liabilities = owners equity</p>
        <p>- Assets = liabilities (plus) owners equity</p>
        <p>- Liquidity ratios indicate the ability of a business to pay its bills.</p>
        <p>- Current ratio: current assets (divided) current liabilities.</p>
        <p>- Quick ratio: current assets (minus) inventory (divided) current liabilities.</p>
