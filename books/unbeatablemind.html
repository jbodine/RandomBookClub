      <h2>Preface</h2>
      <p>Einstein said that you can not solve a problem from within the same paradigm the problem originated. [p.12]</p>
      <p>Negative derails performance [p.13]</p>
      <p>The root of "discipline" is to be a disciple of something higher than ourselves — in this case, to elevate the importance of your human development to the same status as eating or sleeping. [p.14]</p>
      <p>Excellence becomes both an ideal and a breath-and-blood habit, and underneath it all, it comes down to choice. That choice is to slow down enough to pay attention to the details. [p.15]</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>When a crisis hit, rather than try and intellectualize or instantly think up a route through the problem, I learned to feel my way through crisis moments. I'd observe how excessive thinking and analysis paralysis had been responsible for injuries and deaths. [p.21]</p>
        <p>We are bred to identify with our thoughts. This is the critical problem. We find meaning by constantly thinking of our body, beliefs, success, failures, rules, and roles in life. [p.23]</p>
        <p>Negativity erodes performance [p.28]</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
      <p>Success is defined by choice, and it's the small choices, not the major ones, that make the difference between good and excellent. [p.37]</p>
      <p>It's a myth that stress is your problem. Your real problem is believing that stress is the source of all your woes.</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Step 1 - witness the adverse stressor as it impacts you and begins to affect your psychology and physiology.</p>
              <p>• Step 2 - Interdict the response to stress.</P>
              <p>• Step 3 - Redirect your psychology an physiology to counter the impact of the stress and transmute it to positive performance.</p>
              <p>• Step 4 - Use breathing and concentration techniques to maintain performance and eliminate the stress from your mind, body, and life. [p.39-40]
          </blockquote>
      <p>Prolonged stress responses may also result in chronic suppression of the immune system, leaving the body open to infections. Interestingly, there is a short boost of the immune system immediately after the fight-or-flight response. ** [p.42]</p>
      <p>Two is one, and one is none. [p.43]</p>
      <p>In a high-pressure crunch situation, put your concentration on breath management. [p.47]</p>
      <p>The inability to recover quickly from a perceived failure can cripple a trainee emotionally; and of the three, physical, mental and emotional, emotional resiliency is the most challenging to take on. [p.52-53]</p>
      <p>Resiliency is assured if you have the attitude of being oriented toward others versus yourself. In Victor Frankl's Man's search for meaning, Victor survived by finding meaning through tending to others' needs over his own... and then by teaching the power of this simple truth. ** [p.56]</p>
      <p>When you are positive and optimistic, you're naturally inclined to look for solutions because you believe a better future is possible. [p.56]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
      <p>Many people gravitate toward the complex because it makes them feel important and distracts them from more genuine pursuits and responsibilities. ** [p.64]</p>
      <p>Dedication must be offset with humor and reality checks. [p.67]</p>
      <p>A lack of authenticity leads to diminished trust. [p.68]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
      <p>Serving your team (family) before yourself is a discipline that requires three supporting attitudes: compassion, generosity, and abundance. [p.71]</p>
      <p>When you have an abundance mindset, you see that there is more out there for everyone, including yourself. [p.72]</p>
      <p>The universal law of generosity states that the more you share, the more plenty you have in life. [p.73]<p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
      <p>Though we may easily see the shortcomings of the beliefs and behaviors of others, we often remain ignorant of our own limitations, which are equal or worse. [p.84]</p>
      <p>Does it really make sense to go through life with an air-tight assumption that all the ideas we have ingested are unassailable? [p.86]</p>
      <p>The law of abundance: this law states that the world has enough for everyone who chooses to see the world as abundant. [p.90]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
      <p>Your actions define your character. It isn't what you think or say that is most important; it is the actions you take, especially when no one is looking. [p.99]</p>
      <p>The speed of trust - Stephen M.R. Covey Increased trust = increased speed and decreased cost. Decreased trust = decreased speed and increased cost. [p.100]</p>
      <p>Learn to trust others by delegating and giving more responsibility and then providing support when inevitable failure occurs. [p.103]</p>
      <p>Integrity in leadership must be framed within a positive service attitude in order to build trust and loyalty and lead to honorable results. [p.103]</p>
      <p>Authentic communication: First pause with a breath before speaking, and then only speak if:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• What you have to say is true, as best you can determine.</p>
              <p>• And what you have to say is helpful or wise.</p>
              <p>• And if what you have to say comes from a place of love and respect—meaning it's positive. [p.106]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>Authentic leadership is not to leap in immediately to "earn your leadership stripes" (unless you have no choice) but to act with humility by watching carefully and being helpful as a follower. [p.107]</p>
      <p>You can't be good at everything, all the time. Knowing that is the kind of humility that earns trust and loyalty. [p.107]</p>
      <p>Never suggest something can't be done, and if you decide to do something, then commit to seeing it through. [p.112]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>Be ready to lead, ready to follow, and never quit! [p.115]</p>
      <p>Tip #4: Prepare more than others. [p.124]</p>
      <p>The world is dangerous and chaotic ... destiny sure favors the prepared in body and mind! [p.125]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
      <p>When you buy a red Mazda, isn't it amazing how your mind confirms that practically everyone else suddenly owns a red car and there are now twice as many Mazdas on the road? How can we trust our minds when this type of gross interpretation is going on all the time. [p.134]</p>
      <p>Since losses are felt more keenly than gains, the side that stands to lose will fight harder against it than the other side fights for it. [p.135]</p>
      <p>Selling a losing stock actualizes a loss while selling a winning stock actualizes a gain. System 1 thinking will favor the latter over the former [p.135]</p>
      <p>FITS:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Fit - Does your goal fit you and your team in terms of your skills, resources, time, and personality? Is it reasonable or a long shot? Will return on your investment in time, resources, and energy be worth it for this goal, or should you be looking at a different goal with a higher return on investment?</p>
              <p>• Importance - Is this goal strategically important to archive your mission or purpose? Will your mission fail if you do not achieve this goal? Is there another, more vital goal you should be directing your precious energy on?</p>
              <p>• Timing - Is this the right time for this goal? What has to happen first for this goal to become a realistic achievement? Is there some other goal or target whose timing trumps this one?</p>
              <p>• Simplicity - Is this a KISS goal? Can you break the goal into smaller micro-goals, aka stepping stones, to increase the simplicity and your chances of succeeding and gaining momentum towards your actualizing your vision? [p.141]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>Goals should be specific and detail, part of the detail is that they are measurable and it is easy to determine progress. [p.141]</p>
      <p>Achievability speaks to your skills and available resources. [p.141]</p>
      <p>All goals must be positively stated to avoid subconscious negativity that may erode progress. [p.141]</p>
      <p>Why take on any goal unless you intend to take it seriously? [p.142]</p>
      <p>A goal should be: measurable, achievable, relevant, time-bound and positively stated. [p.142]</p>
      <p>If your strategy includes a daily goal review during your morning ritual routine and periodic progress review, there is a high degree of likelihood that you'll remain focused and persistent until you achieve it. [p.143]</p>
      <p>A goal without a strategy is like a travel destination without a plan to get there. Many details are involved in planning to accomplish a lofty goal. Write them down in a list, and then establish dates for striking them off. [p.143]</p>
      <p>SMEAC:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Situation - The situation is the background study that helps the team understand the reason behind the current requirements to act. Background "situational awareness" as it is critical for everyone to be on the same page regarding the "why" of the mission.</p>
              <p>• Mission - The mission is a specific statement of what you intend to accomplish, where, when, and the measure of success.</p>
              <p>• Execution - The execution par defines how the mission will be accomplished. the execution also specifies the involvement of others, your course of action, your intended resources, and your plan B.</p>
              <p>• Administration - The administration section of the plan defines the administrative and logical details that must be coordinated prior to and during the execution of the mission or project. </p>
              <p>• Command and control - The command and control specify who's in charge, who reports to whom, and when they report as well as the format for reporting. [p.144]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>So many missions and projects fail due to poor communication and accountability. ** [p.144]</p>
      <p>PROP:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Priorities - What are the key priorities that are driving your mission?</p>
              <p>• Realities - What the ground truth realities you are facing, and what impact do they have on your options?</p>
              <p>• Options - List the most compelling options for a way forward that you and your team have come up with.</p>
              <p>• Plan - what is the plan you decided on? [p.144]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>OODA Loop:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Observe the situation closely - What is your relative position to the enemy and how is their behavior going to impact you?</p>
              <p>• Orient to the reality of your observation - Should you move left, right, up, or down? Should you adjust pricing or move into the marketplace faster?</p>
              <p>• Decide on a course of action - Depending on the complexity and stakes involved, this can be a simple choice or a more complex decision after analyzing multiple courses of action.</p>
              <p>• Act - nothing happens in life until we take massive action. After you take action, you will immediately observe the impact of your action. Orient to the results, make another decision, and the cycle continues. ** [p.146]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>The final skill of mentally tough leaders is to change the content and energy of your mind through structured visualization. (p.147]</p>
      <p>Visualization can be performed from the first person or third person perspective. What I mean by this is that hey can be imagined from your subjective frame as if you had a helmet camera on, or imaged from your objective frame as if watching yourself in a movie. [p.148]</p>
      <p>Visualization: When done well, a visualized event involves the sensations of feelings, emotions, and sounds to support the imagery. [p.149]</p>
      <p>A positive state of mind attracts positive support and teammates to help you accomplish your goals ** [p.150]</p>
      <p>Changing the negative belief and dialogue to a positive one will dramatically impact performance—persoanlly and with your team. [p.152]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>The team affects the individual just as much as the individual affects the team. ** [p.155]</p>
      <p>Have the entire team participate in the setup, the brief, mid-training adjustments, the debrief and cleanup of each training event. It is noticed and frowned upon to have someone pop in midway through a training event, or bail as soon as it's over. [p.158]</p>
      <p>As a leader, you must do your part in creating an environment where failure and risk-taking are encouraged and supported as positive aspects of training and operation. [p.160]</p>
      <p>Not everything is an "easy-day" or will go as planned. [p.160]</p>
      <p>The more challenging the event, the more valuable the lessons and the deeper the mastery. [p.160]</p>
      <p>Create the conditions for the individuals to maximize their potential, then elevate training in importance to further support individual development. Hold teams accountable to high standards of "we" and then get out of their way. [p.161]</p>
      <p>Just do your job well without any expectations of fame or fortune, and move on. [p.162]</p>
      <p>Endeavor to make it (training) as real as possible. [p.162]</p>
      <p>The big four mental toughness skills are goal setting, breathing, positivity, and visualization. [p.164]</p>
      <p>New ideas and improvements to standard operating procedures are encouraged, but not on the fly. The post-training debrief is the place to discuss changes, which can be implemented in future training. [p.169]</p>
      <p>Simple tools and methods lead to more creative solutions and a more functionally effective result. ** [p.170]</p>
      <p>Masters focus on mastering the details of the journey every day, rather than the end state. ** [p.171]</p>

      <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
      <p>Single point focus: The Bris could be speaking German now if he (Winston Churchill) had not held his course. These warriors stepped into the breach to save entire cultures, not their own skins. That kind of selfless determination is the warrior way. Why was single point focus so critical to these victories? Because it allows you to narrow your attention to only the most important things that impact victory right now. [p.173]</p>
      <p>The five key attributes of character:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Desire - related to our discussion throughout this book about passion, for uncommon resolve you must desire the outcome as if your hair was on fire.</p>
              <p>• Belief - you must believe in your purpose, your mission, and yourself.</p>
              <p>• Attitude - you must have a positive, can-do attitude and be able to mobilize a team with it.</p>
              <p>• Discipline - you must be willing to give up necessary attachments and commitments and put in the right amount of daily effort toward your goal.</p>
              <p>• Determination - you must have an unwavering commitment to finish the job, stay the course, and never, ever quit. [p.174]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>Within a few months of launch, a project has taken on a totally new form based on the lessons learned and new directions taken. Rigidity gets you killed on a SEAL op and will get you metaphorically killed in business or in your job. Hold a vision of the outcome you desire, and then allow for spontaneity and setbacks to inform the actual direction on a day-to-day basis. ** [p.175]</p>
      <p>Remember no plan survives contact with the enemy. ** [p.175]</p>
      <p>When things go off the tracks, the master doesn't assign blame and wallow in self-pity; rather he or she immediately seeks the positive lesson. ** [p.176]</p>
      <p>Altshuller's 5 of 40 solutions:</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>• Look at your specific problem, and then state it as a general problem. then find a solution to the general problem, and apply it to your specific issue.</p>
              <p>• Look at your own problem by reversing it or turning it upside down.</p>
              <p>• Look at your problem from another perspective or another dimension altogether.</p>
              <p>• See if you can solve your problem with another element altogether (water, air, etc.)</p>
              <p>• If your problem is fixed, make it movable, or vice versa. [p.179]</p>
          </blockquote>
      <p>The key is that when you hit the point where fatigue, discomfort or pain is almost intolerable, where you feel you can't stand it any longer, with fortitude you will activate a positive attitude and determination to double down on your efforts, while opening to the aliveness of the moment. [p.182]</p>
      <p>Studies have shown that a smile brings the same level of stimulation as eating a bunch of chocolate bars. Smiling releases endorphins, serotonin, and natural painkillers. [p.183]</p>
      <p>There are many brilliant people in the world masquerading as masters. Yet they are incomplete and continue to act with an inflated ego. Lacking humility, they display a mock show of caring for others while acting out of self-interest. [p.185]</p>
      <p>The master approach is to first train for ten years, then teach for ten years, and only then begin to teach the teachers. ** [p.185]</p>
      <p>Humility requires that you surrender your need to control anything but your breathing, mind, and response to stimulus. The best you can do is try to stay one step ahead of things and focus on giving rather than taking. [p.186]</p>
      <p>" Seek first to understand, then to be understood." - Stephen M.R. Covey [p.194]</p>

      <h2>Afterword</h2>
      <p>"One day, one lifetime" has stayed with me since then (BUDS training) and serves as a reminder to me that every day is important and could be my last. I have learned to live each moment fully and in the present and avoid treating every single day as a dress rehearsal. This same attitude is required of self-mastery. ** [p.197]</p>
      <p>"If he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat" - Theodore Roosevelt [p.198]</p>
      <p>Many mistake constant action for productivity and progress. The warrior's way is to first plan for bold action, win in the mind, bulletproof the mission and then, act with boldness. [p.199]</p>
      <p>Steer (yourself) away from being one of the critics, one of those who waste precious energy illuminating the faults and failures of others. ** [p.200]</p>
      <p>Align to win all three spheres: I, we, it. [p.201]</p>
      <p>Never, ever quit. [p.201]</p>
