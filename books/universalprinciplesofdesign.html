      <book>Universal Principles Of Design</book>
      <h4>By William Lidwell, Kritina Holden and Jill Butler - First edition</h4>
      <summary>I first read The Unbeatable Mind in the summer of 2015. project to collect interesting ideas from the books that I read. This site was originally created both as a way to help myself recover from an injury that harmed my short-term memory (since I could not always trust my ability to recall information correctly), and as an anthology that anyone could reference. Each book has the edition I own and every passage has the</summary>

    <section>
      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Objects and environments should be designed to be usable, without modification, by as many people as possible. There are four characteristics of accessible designs: perceptibility, operability, simplicity, and forgiveness. [p.16]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Aesthetic-Usability Effect</h2>
      <p>Aesthetic designs are perceived as easier to use than less-aesthetic designs. They also foster positive relationships with people, making them more tolerant of problems. [p.20]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Affordance</h2>
      <p>A property in which the physical characteristics of an object or environment influence its function. When the affordance of an object or environment corresponds with it's intended function, the design will perform more efficiently. [p.22]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Anthropomorphic form</h2>
      <p>A tendency to find forms that appear humanoid or exhibit humanlike characteristics appealing. Humans are predisposed to perceive certain forms and patterns as humanlike — specifically forms and patterns that resemble faces and body proportions. The classic 1915 Coca-cola "contour" bottle, often referred to as the "Mae West" bottle due to its distinctly feminine proportions. [p.26]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Biophilia Effect</h2>
      <p>Environments rich in nature views and imagery reduce stress and enhance focus and concentration. Exposure to nature confers benefits emotionally, cognitively, and physically. Consider the biophilia effect in the design of all environments, but in particular, environments in which learning, healing, and concentration are paramount. [p.36]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Chunking</h2>
      <p>A technique of combining many units of information into a limited number of units or chunks, so that the information is easier to process and remember. Chunking seeks to accommodate short-term memory limits by formatting information into a small number of units. Chunk information when people are required to recall and retain information, or when information is used for problem-solving. Do not chunk information that is to be searched or scanned. The maximum number of chunks that can be efficiently processed by short-term memory is four, plus or minus one. [p.40]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Closure</h2>
      <p>A tendency to perceive a set of individual elements as a single, recognizable pattern, rather than multiple individual elements. [p.44]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cognitive Dissonance</h2>
      <p>A tendency to seek consistency among attitudes, thoughts, and beliefs. [p.46]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Color</h2>
      <p>Color is used in design to attract attention, group elements, indicate meaning, and enhance aesthetics. Use color conservatively. Limi the palette to what the eye can process at one glance (about five colors depending on complexity). Do not use color as the only means to impart information since a significant portion of the population has limited color vision. Different cultures attach different meanings to colors. Therefore, verify the meaning of colors and color combinations for a particular target audience prior to use. Use saturated (pure hues) when attracting attention and desaturated colors when performance and efficency are the prioirty. [p.48]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Comparison</h2>
      <p>People understand the way the world works by identifying relationships and patterns in or between systems. Key techniques for making valid comparisons are apples to apples, single contexts, and benchmarks.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>• Apples to apples - Data should be presented using a common measure (example: when comparing crime rates of different countries, it is necessary to account for differences in variables such as population, types of laws and level of law enforcement. Include clearly disclosing details of how variables were measured, making corrections to the data as necessary to eliminate confounding variables and representing the variables using the same graphical and numerical standards.</p>
            <p>• Single context - Data should be presented in a single context so that subtle differences and patterns in the data are detectable.</P>
            <p>• Benchmarks - Claims about evidence or phenomena should be accompanied by benchmark variables so that clear and substantive comparisons can be made. [p.52]</p>
          </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Confirmation</h2>
      <p>A technique for preventing unintended actions by requiring verification of the actions before they are performed. Used for critical actions, inputs, or commands. It provides a means for verifying that an action or input is intentional and correct before it is performed. Common examples of confirmation strategies include: typing a password twice to confirm spelling; having to remove a lock to open a valve; and having to turn two keys to complete a launch circuit. [p.54]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Consistency</h2>
      <p>Systems are more usable and learnable when similar parts are expressed in similar ways. Consistency enables people to efficiently transfer knowledge to new contexts, learn new things quickly, and focus attention on the relevant aspects of a task. There are four kinds of consistency: aesthetic, functional, internal and external. [p.56]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Control</h2>
      <p>People should be able to exercise control over what a system does, but The level of control should be related to their proficiency and experience using the system. I.e. the need to provide expert shortcuts is limited to systems that are used frequently enough for people to develop expertise. When possible, use a method that is equally simple and efficient for beginners and experts. Otherwise, provide methods specialized for beginners and experts, and conceal expert methods to the extent possible to minimize complexity for beginners. When systems are complex and frequently used, consider designs that can be customized to conform to individual preferences and levels of expertise. [p.64]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cost-Benefit</h2>
      <p>An activity will be pursued only if its benefits are equal to or greater than the costs. From a design perspective, the cost-benefit principle is typically used to assess the financial return associated with new features and elements. It can also be applied to determine quality for a user perspective. If the costs associated with interacting with a design outweigh the benefits, the design is poor. A common mistake of the principle is to presume which aspects of a system will be perceived as costs, and which will be perceived as benefits. Example: new design features or elements that excite designers are often never used or even noticed by people who interact with the design. In many cases, such features and elements increase the design's interaction costs by adding complexity to the system. To avoid this, observe people interacting with design or similar designs in the actual target enviroment. [p.68]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Depth Of Processing</h2>
      <p>The phenomenon of memory in which information that is analyzed deeply is better recalled than information that is analyzed superficially.</p>
      <p>This phenomenon of memory results from the two ways in which information is processed, known as maintenance rehearsal and elaborative rehearsal. For example, people often use maintenance rehearsal to repeat a phone number back to themselves to help them remember. Elaborative rehearsal involves a deeper, more meaningful analysis of information.</p>
      <p>The key determining factors as to how deeply information is processed are the distinctiveness of the information, the relevance of the information, and the degree to which the information is elaborated. Consider depth of processing in design context for recall and retention of information is important. Use case studies, examples, and other devices to make information relevant to an audience. [p.72]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Development Cycle</h2>
      <p>The four basic stages of creation for all products: requirements, design, development, and testing. Gather requirements through control interactions with Target audiences, rather than simple feedback or speculation by team members. [p.78]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Errors</h2>
      <p>Most accidents are thought to be caused by what is referred to as human error, yet most accidents are actually due to design errors rather than errors of human operation. There are two basic types of errors: slips and mistakes.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>• Slips are when an action is not what was intended. Minimize slips by providing clear feedback in actions. Make error messages clear, and include the consequences of the error, as well as corrective actions, if possible.</p>
          <p>• Mistakes occur when an intention is inappropriate. Mistakes are caused by conscious mental processes and frequently result from stress or decision-making biases. minimize mistakes by increasing situational awareness and reducing environmental noise.</P>
        </blockquote>
      <p>Always incorporate the principle of forgiveness into a design. [P.82]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Expectation Effect</h2>
      <p>A phenomenon in which perception and behavior changes as a result of personal expectations or the expectations of others. Generally, when people are aware of a probable or desired outcome. their perceptions and behavior are affected in some way. This effect demonstrates that expectations can greatly influence perceptions and behavior. The Rosenthal effect (for example) — Teachers treat students differently based on their expectations of how students perform. [p.84]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Exposure Effect</h2>
      <p>The exposure effect occurs when stimuli are repeatedly presented and, as a result, are increasingly well-liked and accepted. The strongest exposure effects are seen with photographs, meaningful words, names, and simple shapes; the smallest effects are seen with icons, people, and auditory stimuli. Familiarity plays a primary role in aesthetic appeal and acceptance; people like things more when frequently exposed to them. [p.86]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Face-ism Ratio</h2>
      <p>Images depicting a person with a high face-ism ratio — the face takes up most of the image — focus attention on the person’s intellectual and personality attributes. Images depicting a person in a low face-ism ratio—the body takes up most of the image-focus attention on the physical and sensual attributes of the person. Irrespective of gender, people rate individuals in high face-ism images as being more intelligent, dominant, and ambitious than individuals in low face-ism images. [p.88]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fitts Law</h2>
      <p>The time required to move to a target is a function of the target size and distance to the target. According to Fitts' law, the smaller and more distant a target, the longer it will take to move to a resting position over the target. The faster the required movement and the smaller the target, the greater the error rate due to a speed-accuracy tradeoff. [p.98]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Five Hat Racks</h2>
      <p>There are five ways to organize information: category, time, location, alphabet, and continuum. The organization of information is one of the most powerful factors influencing the way people think about and interact with a design. [p.100]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Flexibility-Useability</h2>
      <p>As the flexibility of a system increases, the usability of the system decreases. The flexibility-usability tradeoff is related to the well-known maxim, jack of all trades, master of none. It is a common assumption that designs should always be made as flexible as possible. However, flexibility has real costs in terms of complexity, usability, time, and money; it generally pays dividends only when an audience cannot clearly anticipate its future needs. "When an audience has a clear understanding of its needs, favor specialized designs that target those needs as efficiently as possible. When an audience has a poor understanding of its needs, favor flexible designs to address the broadest possible set of future applications. [p.102]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Forgiveness</h2>
      <p>Designs should help people avoid errors and minimize the negative consequences of errors when they do occur. Human error is inevitable, but it need not be catastrophic. Forgiveness in design helps prevent errors before they occur and minimizes the negative consequences of errors when they do occur. Common strategies for incorporating forgiveness in designs include: Good Affordances, Reversibility of Actions, Safety Nets, Confirmation, Warnings, and Help. The preferred methods of achieving forgiveness in a design are affordances, reversibility of actions, and safety nets. Designs that effectively use these strategies require minimal confirmations, warnings, and help. [p.104]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Framing</h2>
      <p>A technique that influences decision making and judgment by manipulating the way information is presented. Framing is the use of images, words, and context to manipulate how people think about something. Information can be presented in such a way as to emphasize the positive (e.g. glass is half-full or the negative e.g. glass is half-empty). [p.108]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Freeze-Flight-Fight-Forfeit</h2>
      <p>The ordered sequence of responses to acute stress in humans.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>• Freeze - A state of hyperawareness and hypervigilance; the purpose is to detect potential threats (“stop, look, and listen" response).</p>
          <p>• Flight - A state of fear and panic; the purpose is to escape from the threat.</p>
          <p>• Fight - A state of desperation and aggression; the purpose is to neutralize the threat (“fight for your life" response).</p>
          <p>• Forfeit - A state of tonic immobility and paralysis; the purpose is to surrender to the perceived threat (“playing dead" response). These stages are innate responses that operate in all humans (and mammals generally), though the triggers for each stage vary widely from person to person. Depending on the strength of the threat stimulus, the response can skip stages. [p.110]</p>
        </blockquote>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
      <p>The time required to make a decision is a function of the number of available options. It is used to estimate how long it will take for people to make a decision when presented with multiple choices. [p.120]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
      <p>Increasing the visibility of the hierarchical relationships within a system is one of the most effective ways to increase knowledge about the system. There are three basic ways to visually represent hierarchy: trees, nests, and stairs. Tree structures illustrate hierarchical relationships by locating child elements below or to the right of parent elements. Nest structures illustrate hierarchical relationships by visually containing child elements within parent elements, as in a Venn diagram. Stair structures illustrate hierarchical relationships by stacking child elements below and to the right of parent elements, as in an outline. [p.122]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Hierarchy Of Needs</h2>
      <p>In order for a design to be successful, it must meet people's basic needs before it can attempt to satisfy higher-level needs. The five key levels of needs are: Functionality, Reliability, Usability, Proficiency, and Creativity. Consider the hierarchy of needs in design, and ensure that lower-level needs are satisfied before resources are devoted to serving higher-level needs. [p.124]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Highlighting</h2>
      <p>Highlighting is an effective technique for bringing attention to elements of a design. If applied improperly, however, highlighting can be ineffective, and actually, reduce performance in these areas. Highlight no more than 10 percent of the visible design; highlighting effects are diluted as the percentage increases. Examples of highlighting are the use of: Bold, italics, and underlining, Typeface, Color, and Inversing. [p.126]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Horror Vcvi</h2>
      <p>A Latin expression meaning "fear of emptiness. Horror vacui is a tendency to favor filling blank spaces with objects and elements over leaving spaces blank or empty. An example of this are three shop windows with varying levels of merchandise on display. The perceived value of the merchandise and prestige of the store are generally inversely related to the visual complexity of the display. [p.128]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
      <p>All products progress sequentially through four stages of existence: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. During the introduction phase, work closely with early adopters to refine and tune products. During the growth stage, focus on scaling product supply and performance. During the maturity stage, focus on customer satisfaction through performance enhancements and improved support. During the decline, focus on facilitating the transition to next-generation products. [p.150]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mental Model</h2>
      <p>People understand and interact with systems and environments based on mental representations developed from experience. Designers generally have very complete and accurate system models, but often have weak interaction models—i.e., they know much about how a system works, but little about how people will interact with the system. Conversely, users of a design tend to have sparse and inaccurate system models, but through use and experience commonly attain interaction models that are more complete and accurate than those of designers. [p.154]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mimicry</h2>
      <p>The act of copying properties of familiar objects, organisms, or environments in order to realize specific benefits afforded by those properties. There are three basic kinds of mimicry in design: surface, behavioral, and functional. Surface mimicry is defined as making a design look like something else. Behavioral mimicry is defined as making a design act like something else (e,g., making a robotic dog act like a real dog). Functional mimicry is defined as making a design work like something else. Mimicry is perhaps the oldest and most efficient method for achieving major advances in design. [p.156]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Modularity</h2>
      <p>A method of managing system complexity that involves dividing large systems into multiple, smaller self-contained systems. Modules should be designed to hide their internal complexity and interact with other modules through simple interfaces. The benefits of modular design are not without costs: modular systems are significantly more complex to design than nonmodular systems. Designers must have significant knowledge of the inner workings of a system and its environment to decompose the systems into modules, and then make those modules function together as a whole. [p.160]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Most Advanced Yet Acceptable</h2>
      <p>A method for determining the most commercially viable aesthetic for a design. The (MAYA) principle asserts that the most advanced form of an object or environment that is still recognizable as something familiar will have the best prospects for commercial success. [p.162]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Normal Distribution</h2>
      <p>A term used to describe a set of data, that when plotted, forms the shape of a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve. The resulting bell-shaped curve is symmetrical, rising from a small number of cases at both extremes to a large number of cases in the middle. Normal distributions are found everywhere—annual temperature averages, stock market fluctuations, student test scores—and are thus commonly used to determine the parameters of a design. Where possible, create designs that will accommodate 98 percent of the population; namely, the first to the 99th percentile. While design considerations can be expanded to accommodate a larger portion of the population, generally, the larger the audience accommodated, the greater the costs. [p.166]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Not Invented Here Syndrom</h2>
      <p>A bias against ideas and innovations that originate elsewhere. The (NIH) syndrome is an organizational phenomenon in which groups resist ideas and inputs from external sources, often resulting in subpar performance and redundant effort (i.e., “reinventing the wheel”). [p168]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ockham's Razor</h2>
      <p>Given a choice between functionally equivalent designs, the simplest design should be selected. Implicit in Ockham’s razor is the idea that unnecessary elements decrease a design's efficiency, and increase the probability of unanticipated consequences. [p.172]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Performance Load</h2>
      <p>The greater the effort to accomplish a task, the less likely the task will be accomplished successfully. Performance load consists of two types of loads: cognitive load and kinematic load. Cognitive load is the amount of mental activity—perception, memory, problem-solving required to accomplish a goal. A kinematic load is the degree of physical activity — the number of steps or movements, or amount of force—required to accomplish a goal. [p.178]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Performance vs Preference</h2>
      <p>The designs that help people perform optimally are often not the same as the designs that people find most desirable. The best way to correctly balance performance and preference in design is to accurately determine the importance of performance versus preference. The best method of obtaining accurate requirements is to observe people interacting with the design in real contexts. [p.180]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Progressive Disclosure</h2>
      <p>A strategy for managing information complexity in which only necessary or requested information is displayed at any given time. Information presented to a person who is not interested or ready to process it is effectively noise. Use progressive disclosure to reduce information complexity, especially when people interacting with the design are novices or infrequent users. [p.188]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Proximity</h2>
      <p> Elements that are close together are perceived to be more related than elements that are farther apart. [p.196]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Readability</h2>
      <p>Readability is determined by factors such as word length, word commonality - sentence length, number of clauses in a sentence, and number of syllables in a sentence. For enhanced readability, omit needless words and punctuation, but be careful not to sacrifice meaning or clarity in the process. Avoid acronyms, jargon, and untranslated quotations in foreign languages. Keep sentence length appropriate for the intended audience. [p.198]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Recognition Over Recall</h2>
      <p>Memory for recognizing things is better than memory for recalling things. Recognition memory is attained through exposure and does not necessarily involve any memory about the origin, context, or relevance. Decision-making is also strongly influenced by recognition. A familiar option is often selected over an unfamiliar option, even when the unfamiliar option may be the best choice. Minimize the need to recall information from memory whenever possible. Use readily accessible menus, decision aids, and similar devices to make available options clearly visible. [p.200]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Satisficing</h2>
      <p>The best design decision is not always the optimal design decision. In certain circumstances, the success of a design is better served by design decisions that roughly satisfy (i.e., satisfice), rather than optimally satisfy, design requirements. [p.210]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Scarcity</h2>
      <p>Items and opportunities become more desirable when they are perceived to be in short supply or occur infrequently. The five tactics are commonly employed to apply the principle: Exclusive Information, Limited Access, Limited, Limited Number, and Suddenness. [p.216]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Serial Position Effects</h2>
      <p>A phenomenon of memory in which items presented at the beginning and end of a list are more likely to be recalled than items in the middle of a list. Recency effects occur because the last few items in a list are still in working memory, and readily available. Present important items at the beginning or end of a list (versus the middle) in order to maximize recall. [p.220]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Signal To Noise Ratio</h2>
      <p>The ratio of relevant to irrelevant information in a display. The highest possible signal-to-noise ratio is desirable in design. Maximizing signal means clearly communicating information with minimal degradation. Signal degradation occurs when information is presented inefficiently: unclear writing, inappropriate graphs, or ambiguous icons and labels. Minimizing noise means removing unnecessary elements, and minimizing the expression of necessary elements. [p.224]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Similarity (Gestalt)</h2>
      <p>Elements that are similar are perceived to be more related than elements that are dissimilar. The grouping resulting from similarity reduces complexity and reinforces the relatedness of design elements. [p.226]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Stickiness</h2>
      <p>Stickiness applies to anything that can be seen, heard, or touched—slogans, advertisements, and products. Six variables appear to be key in the creation of sticky ideas: Simplicity, Surprise, Concreteness, Credibility, Emotion, and Story. [p.228]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Storytelling</h2>
      <p>Good storytelling experiences generally require certain fundamental elements. The fundamental elements are: Setting, Characters, Plot, Invisibility (the awareness of the storyteller fades), Mood and Movement. [p.230]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Stickiness</h2>
      <p>The act of measuring certain sensitive variables in a system can alter them, and confound the accuracy of the measurement. This principle is based on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in physics. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that both the position and momentum an atomic particle cannot be known because of the simple act of measuring either one of them affects the other. The uncertainty introduced by a measure is a function of the sensitivity of variables in a system, and the invasiveness of the measure. Sensitivity refers to the ease with which a variable in a system is altered by the measure, Invasiveness refers to the amount of interference introduced by the measure. [p.244]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Uniform Connectedness</h2>
      <p>Elements that are connected by uniform visual properties, such as color, are perceived to be more related than elements that are not connected. Uniform connectedness will generally overpower the other Gestalt principles. Use uniform connectedness to visually connect, or group elements in a design. [p.246]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Veblen Effect</h2>
      <p>A tendency to find a product desirable because it has a high price. [p.248]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Visibility</h2>
      <p>The usability of a system is improved when its status and methods of use are clearly visible. Visibility of complex systems is essential for problem-solving — especially in times of stress. [p.250]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wabi-Saabi</h2>
      <p>Objects and environments that embody naturalness, simplicity, and subtle imperfection achieve a deeper, more meaningful aesthetic. The term brings together two distinct concepts: Wabi, which refers to a kind of transcendental beauty achieved through subtle imperfection, such as pottery that reflects its handmade craftsmanship; and Sabi, which refers to the beauty that comes with time, such as the patina found on aged copper. [p.256]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wayfinding</h2>
      <p>The process of using spatial and environmental information to navigate to a destination. The basic process of wayfinding involves the same four stages: Orientation, Route, Decision, Route Monitoring, and Destination Recognition. [p.260]</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Weakest Link</h2>
      <p>The use of a weak element that will fail in order to protect other elements in the system from damage. The weakest link in a system exists by design or by default—either way, it is always present. Therefore, consider the weakest link principle when designing systems in which failures affect multiple elements. [p.262]</p>
